**Lai Wei** is a biomedical and mechanical engineer currently pursuing his Ph.D. in the BioMEMS & Single Molecule Dynamics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, led by Dr. Tza-Huei (Jeff) Wang. His doctoral research focuses on the development of advanced **biosensing and medical diagnostic platforms** through the integration of microfluidics, BioMEMS, and optical technologies. In particular, his work aims to enable high-resolution and single-cell analysis for rapid, precise, and quantitative molecular detection. By combining microscale engineering with optical instrumentation, he seeks to advance next-generation diagnostic systems that improve sensitivity, speed, and translational potential in clinical applications.
Lai Wei received his bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering from The George Washington University, where he conducted research in the Microfluidics and Biosensors Laboratory under the mentorship of Dr. Zhenyu Li. His undergraduate research centered on **microfluidics-enabled bioreactors** for cardiovascular tissue engineering and biofilm studies. Through the design and fabrication of microfluidic platforms, he investigated cellular microenvironments and dynamic culture conditions to better model physiological systems.
In addition to his research contributions, Lai Wei has developed strong interdisciplinary expertise spanning laser optics system design and construction, microfluidics and microfabrication, computer-aided design (CAD), rapid prototyping, and wet-laboratory experimentation. He has hands-on experience integrating optical components, designing and fabricating microscale devices, performing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and handling clinical samples in translational research settings. His technical breadth enables him to bridge engineering design, experimental validation, and real-world biomedical application, allowing him to build complete systems from conceptual design to functional implementation.
